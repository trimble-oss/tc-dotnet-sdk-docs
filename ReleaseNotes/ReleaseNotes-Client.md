# 2.0.291

* Missed extension added for deleting attachments from Todo
* The attachments API assymetry is encapsulated: now the result from listing attachments can be directly used for deleting attachments. 
Background: TCPS API uses attachment id property differently in requests and in responses. In request it is a file *version id*, in response it is a *file id* and the *file version id* is tranferred in a different field. This creates incompartibility between response and request content.
The solution applied on SDK level is that `Attachent.Identifier` and `Attachent.Version` properties are always used according to their names, but when sending requests to TCPS the `Identifier` is automatically replaced with value from the `Version` property when needed.
